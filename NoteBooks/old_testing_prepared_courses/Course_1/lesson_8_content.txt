Lesson 8: Tuning Hyperparameters in Neural Networks

Lesson Description:
Learn about hyperparameter tuning and how it can improve the performance of your neural network models. This includes selecting the right learning rate, batch size, and number of hidden layers.

1. What Are Hyperparameters?
Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before the training process begins and cannot be learned directly from the data. These include the learning rate, batch size, number of hidden layers, number of neurons in each layer, and regularization parameters.

Hyperparameter tuning involves selecting the best combination of hyperparameters to improve model performance.

2. The Learning Rate
The learning rate is one of the most important hyperparameters in training a neural network. It determines how much the model's weights are updated in response to the gradient during training.

- **Too High**: A learning rate that’s too high can lead to the model overshooting the optimal solution, causing instability and poor performance.
- **Too Low**: A learning rate that’s too low will lead to very slow convergence, and the model might get stuck in local minima.

A good strategy is to start with a moderate learning rate and adjust it as needed.

3. Batch Size
Batch size determines how many training samples are processed before the model’s weights are updated. There are three common approaches:

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Uses a batch size of 1 (one training sample at a time).
- **Mini-Batch Gradient Descent**: Uses a batch size larger than 1 but smaller than the entire dataset (commonly 32, 64, or 128).
- **Batch Gradient Descent**: Uses the entire dataset as one batch for each update.

Choosing the right batch size affects training time, model performance, and generalization. Smaller batch sizes tend to generalize better but take longer to train, while larger batch sizes speed up training but may lead to poorer generalization.

4. Number of Hidden Layers and Neurons
The architecture of a neural network includes the number of hidden layers and the number of neurons in each layer. These hyperparameters control the capacity of the network:

- **Too Few Layers/Neurons**: The network might be too simple to capture the complexity of the data, leading to underfitting.
- **Too Many Layers/Neurons**: The network might become too complex, overfitting the data and failing to generalize well.

Finding the right balance between too few and too many layers or neurons is key to building an effective model.

5. Regularization Strength
Hyperparameters related to regularization, such as the strength of L2 regularization (`λ`), dropout rate, and early stopping criteria, also need to be tuned. Regularization helps to prevent overfitting and ensures the model generalizes well to unseen data.

The regularization strength should be adjusted based on the model’s performance on the training and validation sets.

6. Grid Search for Hyperparameter Tuning
Grid search is a common method for hyperparameter tuning. It involves defining a set of possible values for each hyperparameter and evaluating all possible combinations.

- Example: If you are tuning the learning rate and batch size, you might evaluate combinations like:
  - Learning rate: [0.01, 0.001, 0.0001]
  - Batch size: [32, 64, 128]

Grid search is computationally expensive because it evaluates every possible combination, but it is exhaustive and guarantees the best combination from the defined grid.

7. Random Search
Random search is another approach to hyperparameter tuning. Instead of evaluating all combinations, it randomly samples from the hyperparameter space.

- This method is often more efficient than grid search, especially when dealing with a large hyperparameter space. It doesn’t guarantee finding the best combination, but it can provide a good solution faster.

8. Bayesian Optimization
Bayesian optimization is a more sophisticated method for hyperparameter tuning. It uses probabilistic models to predict which hyperparameters are likely to improve performance and evaluates those first. This allows for more efficient exploration of the hyperparameter space compared to grid and random search.

9. Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is a technique used to assess the generalization of a model. The training set is divided into multiple subsets (folds), and the model is trained on different subsets, with performance averaged across the folds. This helps in tuning hyperparameters and avoiding overfitting.

- **k-fold Cross-Validation**: A common method where the data is split into `k` subsets. The model is trained `k` times, each time using a different fold as the validation set and the others as the training set.

Cross-validation provides a more reliable estimate of model performance compared to a single train-test split.

10. Conclusion
Tuning hyperparameters is essential for improving the performance of neural networks. By experimenting with the learning rate, batch size, number of layers, and regularization parameters, you can find the best configuration for your model. Grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization are popular methods for hyperparameter tuning. In the next lesson, we will explore real-world applications of neural networks.
