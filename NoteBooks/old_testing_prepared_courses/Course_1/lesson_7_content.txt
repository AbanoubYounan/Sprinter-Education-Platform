Lesson 7: Regularization in Neural Networks

Lesson Description:
This lesson focuses on techniques to prevent overfitting in neural networks, such as L2 regularization, dropout, and data augmentation.

1. What is Overfitting?
Overfitting occurs when a neural network learns the training data too well, including the noise or outliers, and fails to generalize to unseen data. The model becomes too complex and essentially memorizes the training examples, leading to poor performance on new data.

Regularization techniques help prevent overfitting by simplifying the model or forcing it to generalize better.

2. L2 Regularization (Ridge Regularization)
L2 regularization adds a penalty term to the loss function that discourages large weights. This penalty helps prevent the model from becoming too complex and overfitting the data.

- Formula: `L2 Loss = L(w) + λ * Σ w_i^2` where:
  - `L(w)` is the original loss function.
  - `λ` is the regularization strength (hyperparameter).
  - `w_i` are the model weights.
  
The parameter `λ` controls the degree of regularization; larger values of `λ` lead to stronger regularization, which results in smaller weights.

3. L1 Regularization (Lasso Regularization)
L1 regularization is another form of regularization that adds the sum of the absolute values of the weights to the loss function. This tends to push some weights to zero, effectively performing feature selection by removing unimportant features.

- Formula: `L1 Loss = L(w) + λ * Σ |w_i|`

L1 regularization can create sparse models where certain parameters become zero, which can be beneficial for feature selection in high-dimensional data.

4. Dropout
Dropout is a technique that randomly "drops" (sets to zero) a fraction of the neurons in a layer during training. This forces the network to learn redundant representations of the data and reduces dependency on specific neurons.

- Dropout is typically applied during training and not during inference (testing phase).

Dropout helps to prevent neurons from co-adapting too much, thus reducing overfitting. A common value for the dropout rate is 0.5 (i.e., half of the neurons are randomly dropped during training).

5. Data Augmentation
Data augmentation artificially increases the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the original data. For example, images can be rotated, flipped, or cropped to create new, slightly modified images.

- Data augmentation is commonly used in computer vision but can be applied to other domains (e.g., time series, text) as well.

By artificially increasing the size of the dataset, data augmentation helps the model generalize better and reduces the risk of overfitting.

6. Early Stopping
Early stopping is a regularization technique where the model’s training is stopped once the performance on the validation set starts to degrade, even if the training loss continues to improve. This helps to prevent overfitting by halting the training before the model starts memorizing the noise in the data.

- Early stopping monitors the validation error and stops the training if the error increases over several iterations.

This method helps avoid overfitting without the need for complex regularization methods.

7. Batch Normalization
Batch normalization normalizes the output of each layer to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one. This helps the network converge faster and reduces overfitting by stabilizing the learning process.

- Batch normalization is typically applied after the activation function in each layer.

By normalizing the input to each layer, batch normalization improves the flow of gradients, making training faster and more stable.

8. Conclusion
Regularization techniques like L2 regularization, dropout, and data augmentation are essential for training robust neural networks. They help prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. In the next lesson, we will explore how to tune hyperparameters in neural networks to improve their performance.
