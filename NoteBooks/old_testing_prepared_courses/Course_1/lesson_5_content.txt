1. What is Deep Learning?
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers. These networks can learn from large datasets and make predictions for complex tasks like image recognition and speech processing.

2. Shallow vs. Deep Neural Networks
- Shallow Networks: Networks with one or two layers, capable of handling simpler tasks.
- Deep Networks: Networks with many layers, able to learn complex patterns. Deep networks can capture more complex relationships in data than shallow networks.

3. Challenges in Deep Learning
- Data Requirements: Deep learning models need large amounts of labeled data.
- Computational Power: Requires GPUs for training, which can be expensive and time-consuming.
- Overfitting: Deep networks can memorize training data instead of generalizing.
- Interpretability: Deep models are often considered "black boxes" and are difficult to interpret.

4. Key Architectural Choices
- Number of Layers: The depth of the network affects its learning ability. Deeper networks can capture more complex data patterns.
- Layer Types:
  - Fully Connected Layers: Standard layers where each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer.
  - Convolutional Layers: Used for image data, detects patterns like edges.
  - Recurrent Layers: Used for sequential data, keeps track of past information.
- Activation Functions: Determines the output of each neuron (e.g., ReLU, sigmoid).
- Loss Function: Measures how well the model is performing (e.g., cross-entropy for classification).

5. Overcoming Challenges
- Data Augmentation: Increases dataset size by modifying existing data (e.g., rotating images).
- Transfer Learning: Uses pre-trained models and fine-tunes them for specific tasks with less data.
- Regularization: Techniques like L2 regularization and dropout prevent overfitting.
- Preprocessing: Techniques like normalization help models converge faster.

6. Conclusion
Deep learning has revolutionized many fields but presents challenges such as data requirements and computational needs. Understanding the differences between shallow and deep networks, along with architectural choices, is crucial for building effective models. In the next lesson, we will explore optimization techniques to improve neural network training.
