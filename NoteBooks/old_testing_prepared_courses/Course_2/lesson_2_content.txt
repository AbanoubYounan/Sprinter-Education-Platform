Lesson 2: Hyperparameter Tuning and Model Selection

Lesson Description:
In this lesson, you will learn how to tune hyperparameters and use techniques like grid search and cross-validation to select the best model for your data. This lesson will help you understand how to improve the performance of your deep neural network models through effective hyperparameter tuning and model selection.

1. What Are Hyperparameters?
Hyperparameters are parameters that are set before training a model and are not learned from the data. These include the learning rate, batch size, number of hidden layers, and regularization parameters. Hyperparameter tuning involves selecting the best values for these parameters to improve model performance.

- Learning Rate: Controls how much to change the model in response to the estimated error.
- Batch Size: The number of training examples utilized in one iteration.
- Number of Hidden Layers and Neurons: These determine the complexity of the model.

2. Hyperparameter Tuning Methods
There are several ways to perform hyperparameter tuning, including:

- Grid Search: A brute-force method that evaluates all possible combinations of hyperparameters in a predefined grid.
- Random Search: A method that samples from the hyperparameter space randomly. It is more efficient than grid search, especially with a large number of hyperparameters.
- Bayesian Optimization: A more sophisticated approach that uses probabilistic models to predict which hyperparameters are likely to improve performance.

3. Cross-Validation
Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model generalizes to unseen data. It involves splitting the training data into multiple folds and training the model on different folds while validating it on the remaining folds.

- k-Fold Cross-Validation: The data is split into k subsets (folds). The model is trained k times, each time using a different fold as the validation set.
- Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation: A special case of k-fold cross-validation where k is equal to the number of data points, resulting in a model being trained n times, with each data point serving as the validation set once.

4. The Bias-Variance Tradeoff
When tuning hyperparameters, you need to consider the bias-variance tradeoff:

- High Bias: The model is too simple and underfits the data.
- High Variance: The model is too complex and overfits the data.

Hyperparameter tuning helps find a balance between bias and variance, which leads to a more generalizable model.

5. Regularization for Hyperparameter Tuning
Regularization techniques like L2 regularization (Ridge) and dropout can be used as hyperparameters. By adjusting the regularization strength, you can prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.

- L2 Regularization: Adds a penalty to the loss function for large weights, helping to avoid overfitting.
- Dropout: Randomly drops units during training, forcing the model to learn more robust features.

6. Model Selection
After tuning the hyperparameters, you need to select the best model. You can use performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to compare models and choose the one that best fits the problem at hand.

- Validation Set: The data set used to evaluate a model during training.
- Test Set: The data set used to evaluate the model after training is complete, providing an unbiased estimate of model performance.

7. Conclusion
In this lesson, you learned how to tune hyperparameters using grid search, random search, and Bayesian optimization. You also explored the concept of cross-validation and the bias-variance tradeoff, which are crucial when selecting the best model for your data. Lastly, you learned about regularization techniques and how they fit into hyperparameter tuning.
