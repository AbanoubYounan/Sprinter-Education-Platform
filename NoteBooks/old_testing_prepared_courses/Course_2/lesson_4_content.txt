Lesson 4: Regularization Techniques

Lesson Description:
Learn how to prevent overfitting in deep neural networks by applying regularization techniques such as L2 regularization, Dropout, and Data Augmentation. These techniques help to improve the generalization of your models, making them more effective on unseen data.

1. What is Regularization?
Regularization is the process of adding a penalty term to the loss function in order to prevent the model from overfitting to the training data. Overfitting occurs when a model learns the noise in the training data, causing poor performance on unseen data.

Regularization helps to keep the model simple and generalize better to new, unseen data.

2. L2 Regularization (Ridge Regularization)
L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds the sum of the squared values of the weights to the cost function. This penalty term discourages large weights, helping to reduce overfitting.

- **Formula**: Cost function = Loss function + λ * Σ(weights^2)
- λ (lambda) is the regularization strength. Larger values of λ result in stronger regularization.

L2 regularization encourages the model to keep the weights small, which makes it less likely to overfit.

3. L1 Regularization (Lasso Regularization)
L1 regularization adds the sum of the absolute values of the weights to the cost function. It has a different effect from L2 regularization and can result in sparse weight matrices, where some weights are driven to zero.

- **Formula**: Cost function = Loss function + λ * Σ(|weights|)
- L1 regularization can lead to a model with fewer features, as irrelevant features may have their weights reduced to zero.

4. Dropout
Dropout is a regularization technique that randomly sets a fraction of the input units to zero during training. This prevents neurons from co-adapting too much, forcing the network to learn more robust features that work well with different subsets of the data.

- **Dropout Rate**: The fraction of neurons to drop during training (e.g., 0.5 means half of the neurons are dropped).
- Dropout is only applied during training and not during testing or inference.

5. Early Stopping
Early stopping is a technique where training is halted when the performance on the validation set starts to degrade, even if the training loss is still improving. This helps to prevent overfitting and ensures the model generalizes well to new data.

- **Validation Loss**: The loss calculated on the validation set during training.
- Early stopping monitors the validation loss and stops training when it begins to increase, indicating overfitting.

6. Data Augmentation
Data augmentation is a technique used to artificially increase the size of the training dataset by applying random transformations to the data, such as rotations, translations, and flips. This helps the model generalize better by introducing variability in the data.

- **Image Augmentation**: Techniques like random rotation, scaling, and flipping are often used for image data.
- **Text Augmentation**: Techniques such as word replacement or sentence paraphrasing are used for text data.

Data augmentation is particularly useful in fields like computer vision and natural language processing.

7. Batch Normalization
Batch Normalization is not only useful for optimizing deep learning models but also acts as a form of regularization. It normalizes the activations of each layer, reducing internal covariate shift and preventing overfitting by adding some noise to the learning process.

- Batch Normalization can be seen as a form of regularization because it introduces noise into the training process by normalizing activations over mini-batches.

8. Conclusion
In this lesson, you learned about several regularization techniques that help prevent overfitting in neural networks. These include L2 regularization, L1 regularization, Dropout, Early Stopping, Data Augmentation, and Batch Normalization. By applying these techniques, you can improve the generalization of your deep neural networks.
