Chapter 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
Description: This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of machine learning, its importance, and its widespread applications across various industries. Learn why machine learning is vital for handling massive data, automating tasks, and enabling better decision-making. It also introduces Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its potential future impact.

Chapter 2: What is Machine Learning?
Description: In this chapter, we define machine learning in simple terms and break down its core concepts. Explore the three main types of machine learning algorithms: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Discover real-world examples of how these algorithms are applied in various fields.

Chapter 3: Supervised Learning – Part 1
Description: This chapter provides a detailed exploration of supervised learning, a widely used machine learning technique. Understand how supervised learning models are trained on labeled data, and learn about the two primary types of supervised learning tasks: regression and classification. Key concepts such as input features, output labels, training data, and testing data are also covered.
